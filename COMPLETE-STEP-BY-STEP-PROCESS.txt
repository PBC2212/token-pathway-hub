Step-by-Step Real Estate Tokenization & Liquidity Process
Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Setup
Step 1: Legal Structure

Create SPV/LLC to hold the real estate asset
Ensure compliance with securities regulations (SEC, local)
Obtain necessary legal opinions for tokenization
Set up custody arrangements for physical property documents

Step 2: Fireblocks Configuration

Create dedicated vault for this transaction
Set up multi-sig policies (recommend 2-3 signatures)
Whitelist all smart contract addresses you'll interact with
Configure API keys for programmatic interactions
Set transaction policies and spending limits

Step 3: Oracle & Valuation Setup

Integrate with real estate price oracles (Chainlink, Band Protocol)
Get professional property appraisal
Set up automated valuation model (AVM) if available
Configure price update mechanisms

Phase 2: Smart Contract Deployment
Step 4: Deploy Core Contracts
1. PropertyToken.sol (ERC-721 or ERC-1155)
2. LendingPool.sol (borrowing logic)
3. CollateralManager.sol (manage property collateral)
4. PriceOracle.sol (valuation feeds)
5. GovernanceToken.sol (if needed for voting)
Step 5: Contract Configuration

Set loan-to-value ratio (70%)
Configure interest rates and payment terms
Set liquidation thresholds and penalties
Add emergency pause functionality
Configure oracle price feeds

Phase 3: Property Tokenization
Step 6: Property Registration

Mint initial property NFT representing full ownership
Upload property metadata (location, specifications, legal docs)
Set initial valuation in smart contract
Lock property documents in IPFS/decentralized storage

Step 7: Fractionalization (if needed)

Determine number of fractional tokens
Mint ERC-20 tokens representing ownership shares
Set up governance mechanisms for property decisions
Configure transfer restrictions for compliance

Phase 4: Liquidity Extraction
Step 8: Collateral Deposit
Via Fireblocks:
1. Approve CollateralManager to transfer tokens
2. Call depositCollateral(tokenId, amount)
3. Confirm transaction in Fireblocks vault
Step 9: Liquidity Request
1. Call requestLoan(collateralAmount, borrowAmount)
2. Verify 70% LTV compliance
3. Submit oracle price proof
4. Execute through Fireblocks multi-sig
Step 10: Loan Execution
1. Smart contract validates:
   - Collateral sufficiency
   - Oracle price accuracy
   - Borrower eligibility
2. Transfer borrowed funds to your wallet
3. Lock collateral in escrow
Phase 5: Transaction Execution via Fireblocks
Step 11: Fireblocks Transaction Flow
1. Create transaction in Fireblocks
2. Set destination: LendingPool contract
3. Set function: borrowAgainstCollateral()
4. Parameters: 
   - collateralTokenId
   - borrowAmount (70% of property value)
   - interestRate
   - loanDuration
5. Submit for multi-sig approval
6. Execute transaction
Step 12: Verification
1. Confirm collateral locked on-chain
2. Verify loan amount received
3. Check interest accrual start
4. Set up payment schedule
Phase 6: Ongoing Management
Step 13: Payment Infrastructure

Set up automated interest payments
Configure principal repayment schedule
Monitor collateral value via oracles
Set up liquidation monitoring

Step 14: Risk Management

Monitor LTV ratio continuously
Set up alerts for margin calls (e.g., if LTV > 80%)
Prepare contingency plans for market downturns
Maintain insurance on physical property

Key Fireblocks Commands:
bash# Create transaction
fireblocks create-transaction \
  --vault-id [your-vault-id] \
  --asset-id ETH \
  --amount [gas-amount] \
  --destination [contract-address] \
  --contract-call-data [encoded-function-call]

# Check transaction status
fireblocks get-transaction [tx-id]
Critical Checkpoints:

✅ Legal compliance verified
✅ Smart contracts audited
✅ Oracle feeds reliable
✅ Fireblocks policies configured
✅ Emergency procedures defined

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific step or provide sample smart contract code for any of these components?
